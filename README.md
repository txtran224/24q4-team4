# Code Differently-24Q4Team4 Project Kanban(OOP Project)

### Members: Chigazo Graham, Shawn Dustmore Jr., Tommy Tran, and Zion Buchanan  

## Introduction

This project aims to address a real-world challenge by creating a scalable and maintainable software solution through Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) and S.O.L.I.D. design principles. Our focus is on building an application that promotes code reusability, effective collaboration, and adaptability to future needs.

Development will be conducted in Visual Studio Code created in Java, using Git and GitHub for version control to ensure efficient team management. We will follow the full development lifecycle, from ideation to implementation, prioritizing best practices in software design and development. Our final project submission will enable the functionality described by our user stories that can be found in the 'Issues' tab to guide our development process and ensure we meet the project requirements effectively.

## Project Requirements

-  All work must be submitted in our team's assigned GitHub repository.
-  The assignment can be completed in TypeScript or in Java.
-  Must include at least 5 types of objects with meaningful relationships to each other.
-  One of your objects must be a custom data structure that provides for adding, removing, and updating items in a collection.
-  Implement at least two custom exceptions.
-  Write unit tests achieving 90% code coverage (using JaCoCo for Java or Jest for Typescript).
-  Must include an integration test for each user story that demonstrates how your code implements the desired feature.
-  Our solution must illustrate each of the SOLID principles.
-  Each team member must contribute at least one submitted pull request containing working code and tests.
-  Include a README for your repo describing the problem you're solving, the solution, and how you would improve your solution.
-  [Extra Credit] Design a CLI that allows users to interact with your application. Check out the code in lesson_10 for an example in TypeScript, or this file for an example in Java.

## The Problem

Inefficient workflow management frequently leads to confusion, miscommunication, and project delays within teams. When tasks are scattered across multiple platforms or inadequately organized, it becomes hard to see what needs to be done and who is responsible for each task. This creates an environment ripe for bottlenecks, situations where the workflow is restricted or slowed down, causing delays and negative effects to the team's overall efficiency. Therefore, having a clear and organized workflow management system is crucial for improving teamwork and ensuring projects are finished on time.

## The Solution

* [Include a short explanation of how we are applying each of the SOLID principles in our project to demonstrate a deeper understanding of software design.]
* [If applicable, mention how the Kanban board will enhance user experience or meet user needs. Highlighting the end-user benefits can be appealing.]
* [If you can include any metrics or results from user testing (if conducted), it can provide evidence of Our project’s effectiveness.]

## How To Improve

1. [Discuss any planned features or improvements, showcasing your commitment to ongoing development and responsiveness to user feedback.]
